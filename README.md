# -Cab-Cancellation-Prediction-Project
Developed a system to manage and optimize cab cancellations, reducing delays and improving user experience.
This project focuses on predicting **cab booking cancellations** using machine learning techniques. By analyzing ride details, customer behavior, and booking patterns, the goal is to identify whether a booking will be cancelled or not.

## üîó Repository Overview  
- Main Notebook: `Cab_Cancellation_Prediction.ipynb`  
- Dataset: Included `YourCabs.csv`
- Model: Machine learning classification model

## üìå Problem Statement  
Cab companies face high operational costs due to **last-minute cancellations**. These cancellations lead to wasted driver time, increased customer dissatisfaction, and revenue loss.  

**Objective:** Build a predictive model that can flag potential cancellations in advance so the platform can take preventive measures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features  
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature engineering from booking/ride data  
- Machine Learning model training (Random Forest / Logistic Regression / XGBoost, etc.)  
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
